The parser directory is set up as follows:

	1) The files not named "_Parser.py" are named for each of the left side non-terminals in the grammar.
	2) The Parser runs from the file "Parser.py" which imports the other files as needed.
	3) The Parser is a recursive descent parser that uses the grammar rules to parse the input.
	4) The Parser obtains the list of tokens from the Lexer and uses the tokens to parse the input.
	5) Typing errors should have been caught by the Lexer, so the Parser assumes that the input is syntactically correct.
		a) If the input is not syntactically correct, the Parser will not be able to parse the input.
		b) The Parser will raise an exception if it is unable to parse the input.
