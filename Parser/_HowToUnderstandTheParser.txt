The parser directory is set up as follows:

	\\ Parser is the main directory
		\\ TypesAndNames is the name for the Types class and subclasses and the names
			\\ ClassName.py -> holds the name of the class only
			\\ MethodName.py -> holds the name of the method only
			\\ IntegerLiteral.py -> holds the integer literal
			\\ Type.py
				\\ Int class -> holds the integer type
				\\ Void class -> holds the void type
				\\ Bool class -> holds the boolean type
				\\ classname class -> holds the class type
		\\ _Parser.py -> the main parser class
		\\ AddExp.py -> holds the addition expression
		\\ CallExp.py -> holds the call expression
		\\ ClassDef.py -> holds the class definition
		\\ CommaExp.py -> holds the comma expression
		\\ CommaVardec.py -> holds the comma variable declaration
		\\ Constructor.py -> holds the constructor
		\\ Exp.py -> holds the expression
		\\ MethodDef.py -> holds the method definition
		\\ MultExp.py -> holds the multiplication expression
		\\ PrimaryExp.py -> holds the primary expression
		\\ Program.py -> holds the program
		\\ Statement.py -> holds the statement
		\\ String.py -> holds the string
		\\ Var.py -> holds the variable
		\\ VarDec.py -> holds the variable declaration

The Parser is a recursive descent parser and will parse the input file and create an AST.
The rules for the AST and recursive descent are held in the EBNF grammar.
